Website Quiz I made for my History Class

This version is for display of the code. The full and active version is at https://github.com/sesohistory/sesohistory.github.io
You can go on the website by going on sesohistory.github.io

I took the base code of a quiz that was already designed and added:
- shake effect when its wrong answer
- make questions appear in random order instead of going in order from the array
- changed the theme of the quiz
